    "\n",
    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "Now you've gathered all the required skills needed to solve systems of linear equations. You saw why there was a need to calculate inverses of matrices, followed by matrix multiplication to figure out the values of unknown variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "The exercises in this lab present some problems that can be converted into a system of linear equations. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use matrix algebra and NumPy to solve a system of linear equations given a real-life example \n",
    "- Use NumPy's linear algebra solver to solve for systems of linear equations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 1\n",
    "\n",

    "On day 2, they sold 23 bags of coffee and 41 bags of tea, for which customers paid a total of 448 dollars.  \n",
    "\n",
    "How much does each bag cost?"
